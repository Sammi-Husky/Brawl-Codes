# Brawl Codes
Collection of my Brawl Gecko codes, their source, and documentation.

## NOTE ##
Many of the source asm files for this repo are created with a specialized tool. The ASM should be easily portable to any compilers but there are some specific bits which are not.  I will eventually clean up the specialized tool but for now releasing source and documentation is better than not
