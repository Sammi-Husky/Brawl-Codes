Extends the game's random character selection capabilities so that pressing A and dropping the Cursor anywhere outside the Character Icon Space will select a random character, move the coin over the randomly chosen character, and update the displayed graphics (matching the melee behavior) Leaves the vanilla behavior intact, so dropping the cursor over the actual random icon will behave as it does in Vanilla Brawl.

There are 2 versions of the code available, one for each method of customizing the characters that can be chosen from by Random.

### [Melee Random v2 (Custom Random)](https://github.com/Sammi-Husky/Brawl-Codes/blob/master/Melee%20Random/Melee%20Random%20(Custom%20Random).txt) ###
   - Use this version if you use Spunit262's Custom Random code to alter the characters that can be chosen by Random.
   
### [Melee Random v2 (CSS Expansion)](https://github.com/Sammi-Husky/Brawl-Codes/blob/master/Melee%20Random/Melee%20Random%20(CSS%20Expansion).txt) ###
   - Use this version if you use CSS Expansion, as the CSSRoster.dat file includes a random roster.
